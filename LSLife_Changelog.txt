0.2.7
- Rewrote a large part of how my script handles areas on the map and drugs within each area. This enables me greater control of the market and whats happening in that area. I have done in in such a way its easy for me to add new data in future for each area for new events and other random stuff happening.
- Each area on the map now has its own values for prices, supply, demand for each drug.These values mostly stay unchanged across the board right now, but i have plans to make them more dynamic in the next update.
- Wealth no longer exists, its been replaced with:
	AreaType - Currently 3 types. Poor, Normal, Rich.
	CopPresence - Value ranging from 0 - 10 representing the strength in the area.
	GangPresence - Value ranging from 0 - 10 representing the strength in the area.
- You can effectively sell anything anywhere, customer selection has been changed, each drug in each area has its own timer between posible sales. The Length of this timer is based of the drugs demand, Demand is then based of the drugs prefered AreaType vs the AreaType of the place youre selling and the supply of the drug. Supply can not change right now and will always remain at 0.
- None of this new Area data is being saved between games currently and is generated based on its type. This will change in the future once i am finished with how the area data is structured and more testing is done.

0.2.7a

- Random Robberies now require the players current area Gang Presence to be greater than 0. When presence is greater than 0, There is a base 1% chance of a robbery gaining +1% for every 1 gang presence. If you have the bag and gang presance is greater than 4 there is a 10% chance of this robbery spawning a driveby. 
- Gang presence will be reduced by 1 for every ped that tries to rob or driveby you that dies.

0.2.10

- Street dealers location is unknown, Customers have a 10% chance of giving you this information, every level of gang presence will reduce this chance by 0.5%. Once a street dealers location is revealed moving away from that area will cause his whereabouts to be unknown again. If a street dealer dies gang presence is reduced by 1.
- Fixed a few bugs with the new customer selection code. This will fix having more weed customers than should be, and Gang Presence not being able to raise when it should. Also more than 1 type of Customers not being selected when they could be.
- There is now an element of randomness to customer selection, based on demand ontop of the current delay governing the time between posible new customers. Higher demands will have better odds.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the same ped to be selected more than once for a sale.

0.2.11
- Fixed area heat not being reduced while not wanted if the player was in that area.
- More changes to customer movement.
- The Street value of all drugs is now reduced by the price of 1g for every 3.5gs the customer purchased.

   Selling a oz in one go $1000. (28/3.5)*50 = $400 discount.
- You will no longer receive drop request for drugs you're not selling.

Its inventory contents will not be lost instead will be carried over to the new Vehicle.
